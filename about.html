        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in the Chicago suburbs, currently living in southeast Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>I work in the water utility industry as a software engineer. <br> See my LinkedIn for more details.</p>
        <p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time in northern Wisconsin, snowmobiling in the winter and boating in the summer. 
            If not up north, you can find me can find me casually watching sports (üêª‚¨áÔ∏è), a good tv show, or playing a video game. I used to competitively swim, although it has been a while since I have touched a pool. üòÖ</p>
        <p>I enjoy listening to and discovering all kinds of music. My go to genres are house/chill edm or alternative rock, but seriously, I will listen to anything. My favorite artist is ODESZA. You can find me active in the Foreign Family Collective Discord where I am a well known moderator as well as creator of our custom bot for the server.</p>
